Reasons for Inaccurate Form Scraping (and Solutions):

Document Complexity & Format Variations:

Issue: PDF, DOCX, and image files can have vastly different structures, layouts, and formatting styles. This makes it challenging for a single parsing approach to handle all cases flawlessly. Think of tables, multi-column layouts, nested lists, scanned images, etc.

Solution: You've already started implementing some excellent targeted fixes.

Specialized Templates: The addition of specific templates (e.g., incident_form_template.py, advocate_form_template.py, etc.) is a great approach. This allows you to handle known form formats with 100% accuracy by bypassing AI-based extraction entirely. The key here is to identify the specific form with high confidence (e.g., using filename keywords, content analysis) and apply the correct template.

OCR Limitations (Images):

Issue: OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is inherently imperfect. Image quality, font styles, skewed images, and handwriting can all introduce errors.

Solutions:

Multi-Pass OCR with GPT-4o: By providing two opportunities for the OCR to be correct it provides a greater degree of accuracy that would other wise be hard to solve

Pre-processing: Apply image pre-processing techniques to improve OCR accuracy:

Rotation/Deskewing: Correct rotated or skewed images.

Noise Removal: Reduce noise and artifacts in scanned images.

Contrast Enhancement: Improve contrast for better character detection.

Quality Control: If image quality is consistently poor, establish clear guidelines for users uploading forms.

AI Model Limitations:

Issue: Even the most advanced AI models (like GPT-4) have limitations in understanding complex layouts and accurately identifying form fields in all cases. They can misinterpret context, miss fields, or hallucinate information.

Solution: The codebase already attempts to minimize the reliance on this but we may want to improve the extraction by using a JSON Schema

Enforce Output Structure: While you use response_format={"type": "json_object"}, you should explicitly guide the LLM response with a JSON schema. Here's what it may look like
